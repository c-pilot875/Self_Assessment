### Group 3 Project Lead
As project team lead, it was my primary responsibility to organize the project and delegate tasks to team members while overseeing the completion of the project through the following:

* Create and manage the project GitHub Repository
* Distribute project tasks to team members with clear deliverables
* Create the initial Read.me and presentation templates
* Facilitate and lead in class and outside class meetings
* Review Pull Requests and create branches for segment submissions
* Take notes on group discussions and upload to the repo
* Ensure team members have answers or solutions to questions or problems with tasks at each segment
* Establish deadlines for completing tasks for each segment
* Maintain tasks are meeting segment requirements with the goal of obtaining 100% completion

## The Team
Our team was comprised of four individuals with a strong interest in sports data. Once our group was formed in class, work began cooperatively to identify a data set. Searching Kaggle, all team members listed their findings and a vote was taken to choose one data set. The NFL Draft Combine (2009 - 2019) was chosen.

I was initially nervous about this data set because I have limited knowledge in the game of American football. My team members had collectively more knowledge and so I put my trust in their understanding of the data and statistics.
I had asked if anyone wanted to volunteer to be the team lead of which one reluctantly came forward so then I volunteered to be lead and began our project discussion on distributing the main tasks of Analytical exploration, Database Build, machine Learning modeling, and Dashboard creation. The team all picked their own tasks to manage siting confidence it their desired field.

This is my first time as a project lead and so was my greatest personal challenge managing people, I was a little nervous but I was able to find a flow with asking questions of each of my team members on what they needed to accomplish their designated tasks. I took notes so everyone was on the same page as to segment requirements and deadlines. All team members pulled their weight completing tasks on time, understanding their work and next segment requirements. Overall, I am happy with my teamâ€™s abilities, knowledge of data analysis, and willingness to work together at equal levels respecting each other.

## The Project
My main responsibility was to organize the project and the work space for optimal communication and work flow. My goals were to make it as "plug and play" as possible for my team by creating the repo, the read.me template, and the presentation template. The primary and secondary questions of what we wanted to ask of the data was discussed and agreed upon the group. I gave clear instruction as to what each team member needed to accomplish for the next segment deliverable being mindful that each team member would need to manage their tasks independently to set up the data for the next segment. Each member relied on the completion of the tasks of the other to which all understood and respected. We exclusively used Slack and Zoom to communicate.

### Exploratory Analysis
Dylan had the task of completing the exploratory data and data clean up with the help of Ben who had done some initial exploring to determine Machine learning feasibility. Dylan was successful and found comparisons that would help us answer our secondary questions of player statics.

My role was to ask Dylan how we could create data frames that contain data related to our secondary questions such as statistics and count of position type. Dylan did an excellent job at creating and comparing various data frames so the team could gather what data was need.

### Database Build
Lauren had the role of building the ERD and database that would hold our cleaned data. She successfully created and ERD with two tables outlining the main statistics and finding a dataset of the schools listed for the draft.

My role was to provide support if Lauren could not identify a second table and to ask if this database could be used for the dashboard. We ended up agreeing that the database could hold our data but we would use the cleaned csv file to create the Tableau Dashboard since the free version of Tableau does not allow database integration.

### Machine Learning Model
Ben had the task of building the machine learning model. Ben was successful in creating 2 models and exploring a neural network model to generate classes and clusters of the data.

My role was to offer support if he needed and asked him questions on how he arrived to the results so the team and myself could better understand the machine learning process.

### Dashboard
My secondary role was to create the dashboard of our project. Taking the cleaned csv file from our exploratory analysis I was able to create a draft dashboard. I had the team review and offer their thoughts and insights as to which data and charts would best scribe and tell the story of our data. I wanted them to have final say as to what went on this dashboard so they all had an active role in helping to create and polish the final results.

### The Presentation
As team lead, I kicked off the presentation explaining the project, data, and an overview of the work we did. I then turned the presentation to each team member for them to share an overview of their tasks and roles. A Q&A was then initiated to where each team member was free to answer on their own.

## Results
My overall goal for this project was to create a simplistic and friendly work environment where we all felt we had equal parts to contribute. I wanted to do my best with organizing and communication so everyone felt up to date and included. We exclusively used Zoom and Slack for communicating along with Google Slides to cooperatively work on the presentation. Our machine learning model produced an accuracy of 73% which was below what we expected but not terrible. We ended up using a Neural Network model classify clusters. Our dashboard was created with Tableau Public to visualize the results of the secondary questions. Around 50.4% of the drafted players were Offensive position types and the most significant statistic difference was the Bench Press where players really differed. In conclusion the machine learning model used proved to not be that effective for predicting if a player would be drafted based on the data provided. More performance static data could be used to increase the accuracy. I believe we had a successful project worthy of great effort and knowledge; I am proud of my team and the work we have done.
